# Encrust

encrust is a command line tool that converts iTerm2 color files (`*.itermcolors`) to color files usable by Dwarf Fortress.

## Installation

    $ gem install encrust

## Usage

Just point encrust at the files you'd like converted:

    $ encrust gruvbox-dark-soft.itermcolors elflord.itermcolors

Your Dwarf Fortress color files will be generated in the directory where you ran the command, and encrust will tell you where Dwarf Fortress expects them to be.

If you want to try out your new color schemes without having to wait for your fortresses to open and close, try uploading the generated files to the [Dwarf Fortress Color Generator](https://manmademagic.github.io/DFColorGen/). DFColorGen also works great for small adjustments to your color schemes.

## Why iTerm?

I chose `itermcolors` as my input format primarily because it supports 24-bit color and is easy to read.

iTerm2 is also pretty popular, and dozens if not hundreds of color schemes for it can be easily found online.
